# Mood-Detection-from-voice-samples
In the past few years, there has been significant developments in how machine learning can be used in various industries and research. Emotion Recognition based on a speech signal is one of the intensively 
studied research topic. Recognition of emotional state is an increasingly important area in automated speech analysis due to several potential benefits that result from correct identification of subjectâ€™s emotional state. 
In order to obtain emotional-related response from robots, computers and other intelligent machines, the first and decisive step is accurate mood recognition. The human voice can be characterized by several attributes 
such as pitch, timbre, loudness, and vocal tone. It has often been observed that humans express their mood by varying different vocal attributes during speech generation. 
This project presents a comparative study of Machine Learning Algorithms. Feature extraction is done from various voice utterances recorded from different persons using feature extraction algorithms such as Mel 
Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Mel Spectrogram and Chroma. Using these features, we can classify the voice utterances into eight basic human emotions such as anger, neutral, fear, happiness, sadness, calm, 
disgust and surprise by using machine learning algorithms. Different algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and KNN are used in our project to classify the voice 
samples.
